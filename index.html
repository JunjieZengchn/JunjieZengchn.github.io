        IT is a promising field for the foreseeable future, it’s becoming more and more important to human’s lives. 
        I found that I am desired to learn the Information Technology when I realize that. 
        IT makes people’s lives more convenient and entertained, we are sharing our knowledge by IT, 
        we connect with people all around the world by IT. 
        When I was a kid, I watched a few movies about hackers, but the spark of the interest of IT of me is from my brother. 
        He was studying in Master of IT (specific area of Network Security), 
        he showed me how attractive the Information Technology is and I was persuaded. 
        Yet, I learned a little bit of python, html and CSS, I am still on my way to dig deeper into the IT world.

        With the reason why I choose RMIT, I was not quite sure when I made the decision. 
        But after I studied in this university for a while, I found I love the environment of RMIT. 
        Most of the students are friendly, I have some good experiences of studying and working with groups, 
        also the tutors are patient to help with my problem on studying. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I am expected to learn how to build my own website, 
        learn and master in a few programming languages which is going to help me in the future career.
