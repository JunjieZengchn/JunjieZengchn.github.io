    <p>
        IT is a promising field for the foreseeable future, it’s becoming more and more important to human’s lives. 
        I found that I am desired to learn the Information Technology when I realize that. 
        IT makes people’s lives more convenient and entertained, we are sharing our knowledge by IT, 
        we connect with people all around the world by IT. 
        When I was a kid, I watched a few movies about hackers, but the spark of the interest of IT of me is from my brother. 
        He was studying in Master of IT (specific area of Network Security), 
        he showed me how attractive the Information Technology is and I was persuaded. 
        Yet, I learned a little bit of python, html and CSS, I am still on my way to dig deeper into the IT world. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        With the reason why I choose RMIT, I was not quite sure when I made the decision. 
        But after I studied in this university for a while, I found I love the environment of RMIT. 
        Most of the students are friendly, I have some good experiences of studying and working with groups, 
        also the tutors are patient to help with my problem on studying. 
        <br/>

        These three tests generally analyse my current personal characteristics, 
        although the results of these tests are not completely correct (at least to me). 
        However, these tests do show me my potential, for example, from the MGTI test result, 
        I see that I am a practical person and I am introverted. 
        Before I take the tests, I can feel my personal characteristics, but the test results let me face directly to 
        my advantages and disadvantages. These results have helped me understand myself better.
        <br/><br/>
        On the other hand, these results can also help me in my teamwork. 
        From the forming of the group, the other peers can have a quick and basic understanding of me by those test results. 
        At the same time, I can also find my team members with complementary personalities and skill sets according to 
        my own characteristics. 
        When the group is formed, these results which reflect the individual skills and capabilities, 
        can also be used as a reference to the delegation of the works. 
        Moreover, as I found myself a Problem Solver with ordinary creativity from the test result, 
        I can now better define my position in the team.
        <br/><br/>
        Therefore, when I am about to form the group, I might looking for people who have different test result to mine. 
        With the MGTI test, I might looking for people who are not problem solvers; 
        with the learning styles test, I might looking for people who prefer other styles than visual; 
        and with the creativity test, I might looking for people who have a better creativity for ideas and thoughts. 
        With grouping the different people according to the results, the group can be more diversified, 
        and we can work more efficient.

    <h2>Project Idea</h2>
    <p>
        As a beginner in information technology, I have always been interested in web crawlers. 
        I have tried to understand the techniques and knowledge related to the web crawlers, 
        but I found that I must have a certain knowledge foundation of Information Technology. 
        That is one of the reasons why I choose the IT courses in University. 
        There is project idea I want to do is design a web crawlers to collect data and information of movie rating 
        and reviews from all the different video streaming websites/platforms (YouTube, Netflix and etc.) 
        and filmic forums (Roger Ebert, Rotten Tomato, etc.). 
        And the web crawlers can do the analysis with all those movie ratings and reviews and creates my own film lists. 
        The web crawlers can also use for research on what kind of movies are popular in specific countries, 
        the comprehensive rank of all films of an actor and etc.
        <br/><br/>
        The motivation of this idea is from my own experience that I always get confused 
        when I was looking at different movies rating and reviews. 
        The motivation of this idea is from my own experience that I always get confused when I was 
        looking at different movies rating and reviews from different website. Different webs, different people will have 
        different tastes on choosing movies. Different ages, 
        different culture backgrounds will lead to a huge different perspective of audiences to the films. 
        Sometimes I am quite interested into what kind of people likes what kind of movies, 
        because people’s understanding of movies will always be a reflection on their personalities and mind. 
        But for a simple reason, I just want to make my own movies list according to the most complete data analysis.
        <br/><br/>
        The work of this project is just a programming process, the most critical part is to put the ideas into the code. 
        This “product” to be designed is actually a programming code of crawler. 
        It’s mainly including 3 parts of processing progress: collecting data; organize the data; 
        analyse the data and translate into information. The contents of data being collected will be: 
        film ratings, popular reviews, viewing numbers, rate of bad reviews and open-information about audience groups. 
        The crawler will recognize the needed data by the keyword search and validation process which are written into the program. 
        It will go through and collecting data from online-streaming video website/platforms such as: Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, 
        or film reviews forums such as Roger Ebert, Yahoo!Movies and Rotten Tomato. 
        The next things the crawler will do is organize those data into the proper format：
        It organizes and stores data according to their types, sources and size into tables. 
        After the data collection and organization, with different conditions and requests, 
        the crawler will analyse the comprehensive ranks and reviews of the relevant movies for audience and 
        visualize them into charts. 
        The ultimate manifestation of this “product” can be a pack of coding shared on Github for anyone who wants to use it. 
        Or the outcome could be a new comprehensive movie information site that includes lists of rated movies in different types 
        and organized movie reviews from different websites and forums.
        <br/>
        Compare to the crawler techniques nowadays, this project is not difficult and even relatively simple. 
        However, due to the lack of certain commercial nature, I believe that my idea of designing web crawler for 
        movies ranking and reviews is relatively innovative. 
        This project will make it easier for people like me, 
        who like watching movies to customize their own movie list according to the preference. 
        This crawler will be an Incremental Web Crawler as it will update the data collected and content incrementally. 
        It will be set to run in a periodic cycle, so the user can have the latest information. 
        Unlike the other film review websites, 
        what I want to create is not a platform for fans or professional critics to share their opinions, 
        but to create the most completed aggregated movies information site. 
        At the same time, 
        it will make a certain contribution to the market research in the fil industry or any academic research on films.
        <br/><br/>
        The tools to design a web crawler is quite easy, all it takes is a platform for writing python, 
        but it also needs tools to download, parse the website, store and execute the data. 
        With the tools which can download the website one of the most useful one is Scrapy which is design for web scraping, 
        it can also be used to extract data using APIs or as a general-purpose web crawler. 
        The selector of Scrapy can be use for the parsing of the website, or it can also use tools like pyquery or lxml. 
        To store and execute the data it can just simply using txt file or MySQL.
        <br/><br/>
        With the skills that required for doing this project, it needs to know how to write python without doubt, 
        and be familiar with using the tools that mentioned above. More specific, 
        I need to know how to use python to write a crawler, 
        which will involve the writing the script to search for relevant information and validate retrieve the required information. 
        Since web crawlers can easily violate the low and individual privacy, and some website don’t like crawlers visit, 
        it’s required to know the regulations for web crawlers and how to design the crawler that follows the protocols.
        <br/><br/>
        If the project is successful, 
        I will not need to go to every single site with movies to look for the ones with high score 
        in order to create my own movie list anymore. 
        I will not need to follow each of the professional critics just to make sure I have their latest reviews on movies. 
        At the same time, its outcome can also be putted online as movies information website for those fans of watching movies. 
        Moreover, it can provide the relevant evidences with data to the market research of film industry.
